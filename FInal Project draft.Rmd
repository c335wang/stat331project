```{r}
getwd() # make sure that the file is in the working directory

# load the data as a data.frame
birth <- read.csv(file = "chds_births.csv")

# produce the pair plots for different combinations of  variables in the dataset

par(mar = c(4, 4, 0, 0) + .1) # size of margins

P1 <- pairs(~ wt + gestation + parity  + mage + mwt, 
      labels = c("birth weight", "gestation", "previous preganancies",
                 "mage", "mwt"), 
      pch = 19,
      cex = 0.05,
      data = birth)

P2 <- pairs(~ wt + gestation + parity + meth + mht + mwt,
      labels = c("weight", "gestation", "parity", "meth", "mht", "mwt"),
      pch = 19,
      cex = 0.05,
      data = birth)
```

```{r}
# convert categoricla variables to factors

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```
